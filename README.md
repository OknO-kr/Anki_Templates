This Anki theme will help make your English decks a little more effectively. [Janki method](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#spaced-repetition), spaced repetition software is a helpful learning tool for English grammar from beginner to experienced.

The template is built in html, javascript and css. Include fields: audio, transcriptions.

#### Some notes from official site.
> ##### [Self-made versus pre-made](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#downloading-shared-decks)
Creating your own deck is the most effective way to learn a complex subject. Subjects like languages and the sciences can’t be understood simply by memorizing facts — they require explanation and context to learn effectively. Furthermore, inputting the information yourself forces you to decide what the key points are, leading to a better understanding.

 > Do not learn if you do not understand.

### Notes
>Each Anki client and each Anki version may implement card display differently, so you will need to test the behaviour across platforms. 
Currently was tested only Mac clients (desctop and iPad). But was made responsive layout for iPhones versions. 
Also was tested on the Windows 10 (desctop) last version Anki.

## Card Types
The type of card.<br>
 **[Cloze]**
  - Freeform show/hide, question/answer, audio/subtitles fields.<br><br>

#### some necessary operations for this template:

_CronosPro-LtIt.ttf<br>
_CronosPro-Regular.ttf<br>
_CronosPro-Semibold.ttf<br>
_TektonPro-Regular.ttf<br>

### Technical note!

There is a little, but noticeable difference in the display of the font (line-height) in comparison with Anki 2.0 and Anki 2.1. 

For 2.1 no changes require. For correct display of button in Anki 2.0 add the following code in the edit mode, in  "Styling" field to the end of this section.

For templates "Elementary" and "Intermediate":
```CSS 
.win #overlay_title #p_button,
.mac #overlay_title #p_button {
  line-height: 120%; 
}

.mac .overlay .p_app_button,
.win .overlay .p_app_button {
   line-height: 180%; 
}

.win .material-icons,
.mac .material-icons {
    line-height: 168%;
}
```
For template "Advanced":
```css
.win #overlay_title #p_button,
.mac #overlay_title #p_button {
  line-height: 120%; 
}

.mac .overlay .p_app_button,
.win .overlay .p_app_button {
   line-height: 180%; 
}

.win .material-icons,
.mac .material-icons {
    line-height: 168%;
}
.win .appendixes,
.mac .appendixes {
 margin-top: -340px;
